### 3. Questions & Answers
**Purpose:**
The Questions & Answers module allows asking and answering of questions for the product selected.

The functionality contained within this module can be divided into several pieces:
* View questions
* Search for a question
* Asking a question
* Answering a question

This component extends the ability to view and search questions, ask questions, answer questions and provide feedback on questions about the current product.


*View Questions*
* At the center of the Questions and Answers module is a list of questions that have been asked about the given product.
* The questions and their corresponding answers within this list are displayed in an expanding and collapsing accordion. By default, two questions are displayed. Up to two answers are displayed for each question. The remaining questions or answers are hidden until the user loads them using the ‚ÄúMore Questions‚Äù button.
* Questions appear in order of ‚Äòhelpfulness‚Äô, corresponding to how many users have indicated that the question was helpful.
* The list contains all questions by default, but can be filtered to a subset based on user searches.
* If no questions have been submitted for this product, then the list collapses and the button to submit a new question appears near the top of the module.

*Search Question*
* Search terms entered in the search bar filters the question list for matching results.
* After the user types 3 or more characters into the search bar the results will begin to filter to only those containing matching text. The filter continues to update as the user adds or removes characters.
* If the user clears the search term, or removes characters so that less than 3 remain, the list returns to the state where it is not filtered to matching text.
* The search filter works with any other filters or sorts that have been applied, and narrows the results further.

# ðŸŒ­ Mustard ðŸŒ­

Have you ever wanted to view the ins and outs of a random clothing product without being able to navigate anywhere else in the website? Well, Team Mustard brings you Mustard, a true single page shopping experience.

## Description

Mustard is a project developed by Hack Reactor, a software engineering boot-camp, that pushed the boundaries of our front-end knowledge. Throughout this endeavor, we as a team of four, increased our proficiency with React, CSS, testing, front-end optimization, and other concepts/tools. A third party API hosted by Hack Reactor provides the data we need to display and we use these resources to build the features and content for a robust, familiar, and enjoyable user experience.
